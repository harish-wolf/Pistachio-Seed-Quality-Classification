Pistacho

To create a classification model for the Pistachio Dataset, you'll need to identify the most important features. These important features are the ones that significantly contribute to distinguishing between the classes in your dataset. The dataset consists of features related to shape, size, and geometry of the pistachio seeds.

Data Loading and Description
Here’s how you can identify important features and select them:

Understanding the Features

AREA: The area of the pistachio seed.

PERIMETER: The perimeter of the seed.

MAJOR_AXIS: Length of the major axis of the seed.

MINOR_AXIS: Length of the minor axis of the seed.

ECCENTRICITY: A measure of how much the shape of the pistachio deviates from being circular.

EQDIASQ: Equivalent diameter, calculated from the area.

SOLIDITY: Ratio of the area to the convex area, indicating how solid or compact the shape is.

CONVEX_AREA: The area of the convex hull (the smallest convex shape that encloses the seed).

EXTENT: The ratio of the area of the seed to the bounding box.

ASPECT_RATIO: Ratio of the major axis to the minor axis.

ROUNDNESS: A measure of how circular the shape is.

COMPACTNESS: A measure of how compact or closely packed the shape is.

SHAPEFACTOR_1 to SHAPEFACTOR_4: Various shape factors indicating different shape characteristics.

Class: The label or target for classification (e.g., different types of pistachios).

Checking for Null Values
In this step, we check for any missing or null values in the dataset. It's important to ensure data completeness before proceeding with data analysis and model building. If there are null values, appropriate handling methods such as imputation or removal will be applied.

After running the code, it has been confirmed that there are no null values in the dataset. This means that the dataset is clean and ready for further analysis and modeling without the need for handling missing data.

ds.isnull().sum()

I'll start by generating some EDA visualizations and handle preprocessing. Let's begin with visualizing distributions and correlations of features. ​

EDA Observations:
Distributions:

Many of the features seem skewed, with a few possibly containing outliers.
Most of the features exhibit variability in their distributions, which will be useful for classification.
Correlation Heatmap:
Several features show strong correlations, such as PERIMETER and AREA, as well as MAJOR_AXIS and MINOR_AXIS. These correlations might be useful in model feature selection or could lead to multicollinearity issues, which we'll address.

sns.pairplot(ds[['MAJOR_AXIS', 'MINOR_AXIS','Class']], hue='Class')

MINOR_AXIS: The length of the minor axis shows significant variation, especially for Siit_Pistachio, indicating that this class tends to have more elongated shapes compared to Kirmizi_Pistachio.

The scatter plot shows how the AREA and PERIMETER of the pistachios relate to each other. Siit_Pistachio and Kirmizi_Pistachio tend to cluster in different regions, indicating that these features are effective at separating the two classes. Siit_Pistachio generally has higher values for both AREA and PERIMETER, suggesting that they are larger and have a more extended perimeter.

Insight:
The drop in model accuracy after removing the MAJOR_AXIS outliers suggests that every column (including MAJOR_AXIS) plays an important role in maintaining the overall accuracy. Even though some features might seem to have extreme values or outliers, they could still carry important information for the model. Removing them without thorough analysis can reduce the model's ability to generalize or make accurate predictions.

Decision Tree Classifier:
Data Split: The dataset is split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.

Model Initialization: A Decision Tree Classifier is initialized.

Training: The model is trained on the training data.

Prediction: The trained model predicts class labels on the test data.

This forms the basic application of a Decision Tree for classification tasks.

The application of a Decision Tree classifier resulted in a decrease in accuracy. This indicates that the model may be overfitting or unable to capture the complexity of the data. Decision Trees can struggle with noisy data or when there are many irrelevant features. Alternative models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, which combine multiple trees, might perform better by reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

Using an SVM classifier led to a decrease in accuracy compared to other models. This suggests that SVM may not be the best fit for the dataset, possibly due to factors like feature distribution, data scaling, or the complexity of the decision boundaries. In this case, models like Decision Trees or ensemble methods might perform better as they are more flexible with non-linear data and less sensitive to feature scaling.

Key Observations:
Logistic Regression (after tuning) has the best accuracy at 0.901, suggesting that hyperparameter tuning (e.g., using C=100.0 and max_iter=10000) was effective.

Random Forest also performs well with an accuracy of 0.88, but slightly lower than the tuned logistic regression.

Decision Tree has a lower accuracy (0.812) compared to other models, especially in detecting the second class, with a recall of only 0.69 for Siit_Pistachio.

SVM with rbf kernel and increasing C value shows improvements in accuracy, with the best accuracy being 0.791 with C=1000.

Final Conclusion:
Best Model:

Logistic Regression with hyperparameters (C=100, max_iter=10000) achieved the highest accuracy of 0.901.

Other Models:

Random Forest performed well with 0.88 accuracy. SVM maxed out at 0.791 accuracy. Decision Tree had lower accuracy at 0.812, struggling with class imbalance. Next Steps: Further tuning and cross-validation could improve other models, but Logistic Regression is the best for now, ready for deployment.
